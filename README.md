This repo contains the application for my article: [From NgRx ComponentStore to SignalStore: the key takeaways from my demo project](https://newsletter.angularaddicts.com/p/from-ngrx-componentstore-to-signalstore)

The included `SignalStore` library is based on Marko StanimiroviÄ‡'s [NgRx SignalStore playground](https://github.com/markostanimirovic/ngrx-signal-store-playground).

To run the app, clone the repo, then `ng serve`.
